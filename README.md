# Approach 

This project was challenging and helped me learn how to make a CRUD application, but also taught me how to manage my time during a project well. I found that the most important thing for this project was staying on track and accomplishing the tasks I set out for myself. There were a lot of features I wanted to include, but in the end it seemed best for me to aim for an MVP and then build from there. I approached problems one by one and searched for solutions in previous projects, on github, and by searching through documentation. I found that looking through other projects was generally the most helpful way for me to approach these problems.

# Technologies Used
